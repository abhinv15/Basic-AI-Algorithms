# Basic-AI-Algorithms
This repository consists of very basic AI algorithms that can be used to build simple AI-based solutions.

I was introduced to the concepts of Artificial Intelligence in the fifth semester of college. Throughout the semester, as part of the curriculum, we covered the basics of AI and were introduced to fundamental algorithms used to solve a variety of problems.
